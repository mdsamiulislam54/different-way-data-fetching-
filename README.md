🚀 Today I explored 4 different professional ways to fetch data from APIs in React! ⚛️✨  

🔍 Here’s what I covered:

1️⃣ **Fetch API** — the basic native method  
2️⃣ **Async/Await based Fetch** — modern, clean, and readable approach  
3️⃣ **SWR (stale-while-revalidate)** — an awesome lightweight React hook library by Vercel for remote data fetching  
4️⃣ **React Query (TanStack Query)** — powerful data synchronization, caching, and query management tool for React apps  

💡 It was exciting to see how each method handles asynchronous data fetching, error handling, and loading states in their own ways.

📌 Key takeaways:
- **React Query & SWR** manage cache and revalidation effortlessly.
- **Async/Await** makes traditional Fetch more readable.
- Understanding different tools helps in choosing the right one for your project needs.
